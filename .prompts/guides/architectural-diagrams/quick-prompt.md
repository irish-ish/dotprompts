# ⚡ Quick Architectural Diagram Generator

Generate an accurate **Mermaid diagram** to visualize system structure and data
flow quickly.

## ⚠️ **Critical Rule**

**NEVER guess or assume system details.** If information is missing or unclear,
**ask for clarification** rather than making assumptions.

## 📋 **What to Diagram**

**System/Component:** [DESCRIBE WHAT TO VISUALIZE - e.g., "User login flow",
"API request handling", "Component data flow"]

**Purpose:** [WHY YOU NEED THIS - e.g., "Debug issue", "Document for team",
"Understand logic flow"]

**Diagram Type Preference:** [OPTIONAL - "sequence", "flowchart", "component",
or "let AI recommend"]

## 💻 **Code/Context**

```[language]
[PASTE YOUR CODE HERE - the logic you want to diagram]
```

**Additional Context:** [OPTIONAL - any relevant details about system
architecture, external dependencies, or constraints]

## 🎯 **Instructions for AI**

1. **Analyze the provided code/context** thoroughly
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if system behavior is unclear
3. **Recommend appropriate diagram type** based on use case
4. **Create accurate Mermaid diagram** with:
   - Clear, descriptive labels
   - Proper data flow direction
   - Decision points and error paths (if visible in code)
   - External dependencies marked
5. **Explain what the diagram shows** and any insights

## 📊 **Diagram Type Quick Reference**

- **Sequence** → Time-based interactions, API calls, user journeys
- **Flowchart** → Decision logic, process flows, algorithms
- **Component** → System architecture, service interactions
- **Class** → Object relationships, data models

## ✅ **Quality Requirements**

- **Only diagram verifiable information** from provided code
- **Use consistent formatting** and clear labels
- **Include error paths** if shown in code
- **Valid Mermaid syntax** that will render properly

## 🚀 **Generate the Diagram**

**Start by analyzing my code/context and asking any necessary clarifying
questions, then create the most appropriate diagram for my use case.**
